Title: Multiple regression through the origin
Author:  Pierre Legendre
Maintainer: Pierre Legendre <pierre.legendre@umontreal.ca>
Description: Function \code{\link{lmorigin}} computes a multiple linear regression and performs tests of significance of the equation parameters using permutations. The regression line can be forced through the origin. Testing the significance in that case requires a special permutation procedure. This option was developed for the analysis of independent contrasts, which requires regression through the origin.
